"Is this true, @SenatorSinema and @SenatorTester?"
"Twitter is rolling out View Count, so you can see how many times a tweet has been seen! This is normal for video.

@DavidSacks It’s a real problem. Apple and Google effectively control access to most of the Internet via their app stores.
@cb_doge @stillgray @ezralevant @latimes That one was real too
"@stillgray @ezralevant @latimes The reason satire about CNN proposing censorship of Twitter could so easily be construed as reality is because that is the prevailing sentiment of the media!

"@saylor @lexfridman Absolutely, especially if done in collusion with the government"

"@TheRabbitHole84 Wow, they don’t sound biased at all!"
Did you know Apple puts a secret 30%  tax on everything you buy through their App Store?
"Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won’t tell us why"
@LBRYcom Secret suppression of free speech by Apple. Customers were never told. What the hell is going on here?
@jake_k Yes
Apple should publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers
@rupasubramanya @bariweiss Here works
Accurate
@techAU Are you suggesting Apple would use its duopolist powers to hurt Tesla?
Who else has Apple censored?
@LBRYcom What terms?
What’s going on here @tim_cook?
Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?

@RyanZohoury @BillyM2k That’s literally how I found out!
@johnkrausphotos It’s on the todo list
Twitter experienced slight degradation of service today from an old 3rd party tool used to block accounts that had no rate limit (sigh). Should be fixed now.

@AMC_Apee Wow
"@TimRunsHisMouth But freedom of speech is the bedrock of a strong democracy and must take precedence.

"@TimRunsHisMouth As a reminder, I was a significant supporter of the Obama-Biden presidency and (reluctantly) voted for Biden over Trump"
@mtaibbi Interesting development
"@TimRunsHisMouth I’m fine with Trump not tweeting. The important thing is that Twitter correct a grave mistake in banning his account, despite no violation of the law or terms of service.

@stillgray Concerning
@marshallk @Esqueer_ Calling for violence will result in suspension
@marshallk @Esqueer_ Absolutely
"@Esqueer_ Incitement to violence will result in account suspension. 

Currently suspended accounts will be enabled slowly next week after manual review to determine whether they have potentially broken the law or engaged in spam.

Twitter will be a forum for the peaceful exchange of views."
@stillgray Accurate
"@MattWallace888 @saylor @Cryptoking @RBReich If it actually becomes a problem, we will take those and other steps"
"@saylor @Cryptoking @RBReich Deliberate impersonation/deception will result in account suspension.

Individuals can have secondary tiny logo showing they belong to an org if verified as such by that org.

Longer explanation next week."
@MrAndyNgo @ramzpaul Incitement to violence will result in account suspension
"@Cryptoking @RBReich Sorry for the delay, we’re tentatively launching Verified on Friday next week. 

Gold check for companies, grey check for government, blue for individuals (celebrity or not) and all verified accounts will be manually authenticated before check activates. 

Painful, but necessary."
@RBReich Interesting … now pay $8
@stillgray @axios Much Ado About Nothing
@AP But you have piqued my curiosity … who are these “online experts” you speak of?
@AP AP is such an expert in misinformation. Twitter couldn’t hope to compete!
@ThePrashanthCB @viniciuscfp82 Mars plans are still moving forward
@viniciuscfp82 How can it be both illegal and “by the court”? Twitter must abide by the laws of each country or get shut down.

"@semaforben All public holders of Twitter were allowed to roll their stock into Twitter as a private company, but he did not do so. Your reporting made it falsely sound like he did, when in fact he owns 0%.

@schrep Server control team knows because they stop working from time to time. That’s why they have the “critical 40” list.
"@schrep True. Server side can (and has been) brute-forced, but that can’t solve weak Internet connections &amp; older phones.

Worth noting that Twitter in India &amp; many other countries is slow even on latest iPhone."
"@WholeMarsBlog Starlink is rebuilding the Internet in space, so maybe I know slightly more than some guy who wrote code for a website"
"@schrep There are ~1200 “microservices” server side, of which ~40 are critical to Twitter working at all, according to server control team. 

Trimming down that 1200 number, reducing data usage, serialized trips &amp; simplifying app are all needed to improve speed of use."
"@schrep Twitter is very slow in India, Indonesia &amp; many other countries. This is fact, not “claim”.

10 to 15 secs to refresh homeline tweets is common. Sometimes, it doesn’t work at all, especially on Android phones.

Only question is how much delay is due to bandwidth/latency/app."

@nichegamer @abhiharry726 @sampullara That’s what I said!
"@abhiharry726 @sampullara In some parts of the world, refresh takes 30 seconds"
@Popeska @sampullara How many serial requests are made by app to refresh timeline?
@sampullara And we will finally stop adding what device a tweet was written on (waste of screen space &amp; compute) below every tweet. Literally no one even knows why we did that …
@sampullara Part of today will be turning off the “microservices” bloatware. Less than 20% are actually needed for Twitter to work!
"@sampullara I was told ~1200 RPCs independently by several engineers at Twitter, which matches # of microservices. The ex-employee is wrong.

Same app in US takes ~2 secs to refresh (too long), but ~20 secs in India, due to bad batching/verbose comms. Actually useful data transferred is low."

@realpfigueiredo @JosianoPadovani @reportersalles I will look into this
@stevenmarkryan Accurate
"My commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane, even though that is a direct personal safety risk"
Twitter needs to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world. That’s our mission.
"@alex_avoigt Twitter user numbers have increased significantly around the world since the deal was announced.

And these are very early days. As Twitter becomes by far the most reliable source of truth, it will be indispensable."
@BillyM2k @StonksReddit No problem to use a pseudonym. The high-level principle is just that verified users can’t engage in malicious deception.
@dogeofficialceo @EvaFoxU @kylaschwaberow 🤣
"@EvaFoxU @kylaschwaberow We are implementing additional safeguards to prevent impersonation, as well as collective use of Verified accounts by a single individual or organization"
Widespread verification will democratize journalism &amp; empower the voice of the people
@catturd2 No exceptions
Any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark
"Previously, we issued a warning before suspension, but now that we are rolling out widespread verification, there will be no warning. 

This will be clearly identified as a condition for signing up to Twitter Blue."
@JosianoPadovani @reportersalles What censorship are you referring to?

"@Rubiu5 If verified accounts violate terms of service, eg spam/scam/impersonation, they’ll be suspended, but Twitter will keep their money!

If they say 0%, they are utterly dangerous fools."
"@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 But, hey, look on the bright side! At least Russia doesn’t get Crimea in that scenario, so you can be comforted by that thought, while watching the mushroom clouds rise."
"@kadubai11 @spideycyp_155 If Russia faces destruction of their army and utter defeat by NATO, they will use nukes, then NATO will respond with nukes and civilization is over"
"@spideycyp_155 Whether one likes it or not, Crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of Russia by Russia. 

Crimea is also of critical national security importance to Russia, as it is their southern navy base.

From their standpoint losing Crimea is like USA losing Hawaii &amp; Pearl Harbor."
@hyiki22 @spideycyp_155 Exactly
"@spideycyp_155 If Russia is faced with the choice of losing Crimea or using battlefield nukes, they will choose the latter.

We’ve already sanctioned/cutoff Russia in every possible way, so what more do they have left to lose?

"@rschmied @spideycyp_155 @SawyerMerritt @SpaceX Big difference between peace comms vs warfront comms.

"@AkiKivirinta The will of the people should decide whether they are part of Russia or Ukraine, but Russia invaded areas that would unequivocally choose to be part of Ukraine"
"Also worth noting that a possible, albeit unlikely, outcome from this conflict is nuclear war"
This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end – just a question of how many die before then
"Ukraine-Russia Peace:

- Redo elections of annexed regions under UN supervision. Russia leaves if that is will of the people.

- Crimea formally part of Russia, as it has been since 1783 (until Khrushchev’s mistake).

- Water supply to Crimea assured.

- Ukraine remains neutral."

@chazman @aelluswamy Just wanted to emphasize again that our awesome Tesla software/AI team is who really deserves the credit. The talent level at Tesla is incredible.
"Note, you can upgrade your existing car to FSD in 2 mins via the Tesla app"

"FSD Beta 10.69 started rolling out to Tesla owners last night. This build is a big step forward!

"@Erdayastronaut @LevEakins More accurate word is “propellant”, rather than “fuel”. Starship is ~78% liquid oxygen, ~22% fuel.

Booster is purging all 33 engine shrouds in flight to prevent this."
"@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @Caspar_Stanley @IzanRamos2002 All mass necessitated by an engine design should count as engine mass, eg shrouds, TVC hydraulic power or excess purge gas.

"@Kristennetten While it is tempting to focus on one of those arenas as the “hard one”, in fact they are all difficult &amp; important. Tight C &amp; custom compiler too.

An inference computer optimized for energy efficiency, reliability &amp; long life is also critical. Can’t just jam GPUs in the trunk."
@tesletter @Kristennetten Definitely
"@Kristennetten A general solution to self-driving (essentially, real-world AI) requires writing extremely difficult software in the arenas of training, inference, control, analytical tools, data management, hardware optimization &amp; simulation.

One of the hardest technology problems that exists."

"@skorusARK Cars today are far more complex than Model T, with a global supply chain that is vulnerable to force majeure risk.

"@Gfilche Ships are probably fine with iron cells, but aircraft need very high energy density for good range. 

I’m not saying Tesla will do aircraft – we have our hands full with cars &amp; solar/battery power generation – just that max energy density is needed for aircraft."
@DJSnM Indeed
"@rich_teer @Tesla We will try. Preferable for Tesla too, as they last so long. Unlike other makers of cars, our goal is *not* to profit from service. Best service is not needing service in the first place."

@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Sure
"@Adamklotz_ @PPathole Good idea. They are not easy to move over roads, which is why the factory is close to the launch site, but we will support a museum that wants a prototype if they take care of transport."
"@PPathole Most people have no idea Starship exists or how large this beast is!

Body diameter (9m or 30 ft) is bigger than a 747 or A380. Starship thrust &amp; mass are more than double Saturn V moon rocket.

"@TesLatino @klwtts @jpr007 Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen, as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full “parking lot”. 

Just like a car parking lot, where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full."
"@jpr007 Not bad, although new Model S has more range &amp; faster charging. 3 &amp; Y should use long range version, as Performance version is meant for max speed &amp; handling, not max range.

@PPathole Yeah
"@PPathole @Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX Laser links in orbit can reduce long-distance latency by as much as 50%, due to higher speed of light in vacuum &amp; shorter path than undersea fiber"
"@Adamklotz_ @AaronS5_ @crheller @SpaceX More ground stations &amp; less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences.

Looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond &amp; satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping &gt;20ms."

"@crheller @SpaceX Glad it’s working! The sheer amount of work done by SpaceX engineering, production &amp; launch teams is amazing.

"@AngelNDevil2 @torybruno What is not well understood is that ULA *still* has a monopoly carve-out for US government launches for which SpaceX is not allowed to compete, costing the taxpayer twice as much per launch than it should. This is obviously not real competition."
"@torybruno Your company said the exact opposite in 2014 when it got a sole-source, uncompeted $11B DoD launch contract. https://t.co/Abd5sWhZDt

In any event, expendable rockets are as relevant to the future as expendable aircraft. Rapidly reusable rockets are all that matter."
@thesheetztweetz Will look pretty wild with a ship on top
Super Heavy on road &amp; 7th Tower segment added https://t.co/SJIHA3BLhL
"@Astro_Elliott @LifeboatHQ Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry &gt;100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket. 

Aircraft, for example, have moved away from 747/A380 to 777, which has ~100 tons of payload."
@_TomCross_ Million tons to Mars requires R R R
Super Heavy moves tomorrow https://t.co/qHG1SYO46S
"@LifeboatHQ Doubling diameter increases mass 4X, but difficulty of simultaneously building &amp; launching rocket of that size is &gt;&gt;4X. 

In retrospect, &lt;9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass &amp; ~7500 ton-F thrust, which is more than double Saturn V."

@EZebroni @WholeMarsBlog You should notice several other improvements
"Rapidly Reusable Rockets, R R R 🏴‍☠️"
"@Erdayastronaut We’ve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also, booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5."
"@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut First one to fly will, so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. We’re changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships."
"@Erdayastronaut Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower."
@PPathole @Tesla @SpaceX Basic MRI is easier than it sounds good tbh. High resolution MRI in short time with weak magnetic field is hard.
"@torybruno @Dynetics Should I bring a few spare engines … I mean, just in case."

@PassionFlix @ToscaMusk I liked your movie “Hollywood Dirt”!
"@nextspaceflight There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive. Obviously, some things will not go right internally &amp; there will be external issues too.

"@ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). 

Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration."
"@ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.

Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion.

"@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.

However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact."
"@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software &amp; engine. 

Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. If not, then retrofit will add a few more days."
"@SpaceX Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didn’t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn’t needed. 

Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today."

@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
"@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage."
@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.
"@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor"
"@ErcXspace @smvllstvrs T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W."

- Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.

- A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?"

"@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do.

"@PPathole Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere."
"@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Note, this is not the spike protein. They don’t consider that reliable."
"@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses.

@PPathole Strange
"@ryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu."

@reganlovetesla @RenataKonkoly @SpaceNews_Inc Enough already on my plate &amp; Tesla’s. Maybe one day will do a prototype. Those are relatively easy. Volume production with high reliability &amp; low cost &amp; passing all regulations is 100X harder.

@flcnhvy Definitely
"@enn_nafnlaus Exactly. He plays the “poor inventor” card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent."
"@enn_nafnlaus There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard’s problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze’ev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO."

"@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one."
"@teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product"
"@ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough."
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.
@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.
"@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three."
"@EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it’s fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly."
@skorusARK Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
"@WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part."

@flcnhvy @alvianchoiri We’re not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.
@PPathole @alvianchoiri Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that’s needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.
"@alvianchoiri Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster &amp; 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year."

"@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4).

“Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.
“Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo
"@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals.

@PPathole @NateSilver538 Up to 80% false positive
"@PPathole @NateSilver538 Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand."

Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
"@brittanygayle98 Its integrated roof &amp; solar, so should be light enough for almost any home"

"@chraveesh @Teslarati Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area"
"@Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume."
"@Teslarati This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving."

"@flcnhvy @Tesla @thirdrowtesla Ok sure 😀 Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn’t be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory."

"@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity."
"@SPEXcast @SciGuySpace Densification isn’t needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed"
"@SciGuySpace Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy."
"@SciGuySpace Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!"

@RQuiddich Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank — it’s just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don’t collapse when depressurized on the ground.
"@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
"@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."

Rest in peace Syd Mead. Your art will endure.
@kulpability @cleantechnica C tbh
"@John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Many ways to solve this problem, but the power requirements are much higher than aircraft control surfaces. When moving giant body flaps rapidly, achieving high power is much harder than high torque."
"@ShaneAppleton7 @Erdayastronaut Building prototypes is relatively easy, volume production is hard"
@JaneidyEve Headed to Tesla Fremont factory tomorrow to help with vehicle deliveries
@EvaFoxU Biting off more than I can chew. Because I’m an optimistic fool.
@Teslarati Hard to believe it’s almost time to retire Cargo Dragon after a decade of solid service
@BaconMan65 @PhiliChez Exactly
@cleantechnica Will talk about that on Q4 call
"@EverydayTesla Yeah, engineering is ~90% of my time at SpaceX &amp; about ~60% at Tesla"
Barrel on dome https://t.co/kpSIJphbnk
@ajtourville @cleantechnica Took me an embarrassingly long time to learn that
@SteveHamel16 @cleantechnica Sounds about right 🤣🤣
@DonaldM38768041 @Erdayastronaut Beyond awesome. He was the real deal.
@cleantechnica Seems so long ago
@Erdayastronaut Yes
"@cleantechnica Also, I hate deeply nested classes in C++. Had to be said."
"@cleantechnica The less code, the better! 1 point for adding a line of code, but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil."
"@Erdayastronaut Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter &amp; more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It’s like moving the entire wing of an aircraft!"
"@TeslaGong @BrianGilbert_ @Tesla @AusTeslaOwners Tesla merch def needs some love, but too many fish to fry rn"
@TeslaGong @BrianGilbert_ @Tesla @AusTeslaOwners Coming …
@ajtourville @Erdayastronaut Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels &amp; domes?
@Kristennetten @SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut We’re focusing on Boca right now for Starship &amp; Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
@Erdayastronaut Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
"@SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool."
"@Erdayastronaut No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor"
@teslaownersSV @TonyCrisostomo @Erdayastronaut Yeah
"@Erdayastronaut Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020."
"@Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction."
"@DJSnM We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome."
Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it! Starship has giant dome 🤣🤣 https://t.co/qTN2TU02pb
@donnyraywoody @flcnhvy @kulpability @NASA Haha true
@flcnhvy muffin or not-muffin
"@realRickyReeves @Erdayastronaut @NASA Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship."
"@kulpability @NASA New technology development schedules tend to exhibit a version of Zeno’s Paradox — at any given point, you’re halfway there"
"@kulpability @NASA Crew Dragon should be physically ready &amp; at the Cape in Feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months"

@EvaFoxU @TeslaHistorian @TeslaOwnersofMA @JohnnaCrider1 @vincent13031925 @boringcompany Nice
"@teslaownersSV @iam_preethi Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation &amp; electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isn’t critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!"
@ingmutw @iam_preethi @Tesla Ok
"@iam_preethi I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy, but it’s true that everyone going vegan still wouldn’t stop climate change. Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere &amp; oceans is fundamentally the issue."

"@vincent13031925 @boringcompany Certainly worth trying! The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever."
"@JonAttenborough @cFidd Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them."
@ollie_turrell @cFidd Pretty much
@Snipergen @Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version.
"@cFidd No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is."
"@RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted."
"@EvaFoxU @amargosavalley For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net."

"@cyrusposting Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone."
"@Joe__Wakefield @austinbarnard45 @tjq1190 @tyger_cyber @fawfulfan @_Mikemo This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack &amp; suitcase of books.

"@teslaownersSV @Benioff Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects"
"@flcnhvy No, he’s still much faster 🐌"

@flcnhvy @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
"@flcnhvy @Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut It’s not that these things can’t be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers &amp; merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware."
@Kristennetten Future feature
"Turn on auto navigate feature &amp; car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all."
"@Sofiaan @Erdayastronaut Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone’s on data roaming &amp; video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!"
"@JeremyGreenlee @mobiledavidd Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) &amp; side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home."
@mobiledavidd We’re building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
@Erdayastronaut Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
@Erdayastronaut Most people still don’t know it’s there
"Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar"
"@TesLatino @teslaownersSV @tesla_unplugged @TeslaOwnersofMA @Tesla @disneyplus @BenSullins If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?"

@stephenjudkins @flcnhvy Yes
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
"@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."
"@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
@jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much
"@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
"@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?"
"@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
"@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
"@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
"@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"
@flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars

"@Teslarati Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software."
@cleantechnica More to come
@bob_burrough Yes
@rafaelcr @OfWudan Would be odd to expect anything else
"@TJ_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
"@TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed."
@flcnhvy Great poem
"Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row."

@Ingvar_Oolsen @neiltyson @Space_Station Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
"@MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower."
"@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table"
"@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec."
"@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq

"@Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted Yeah, great team!"
"@J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq"
"@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere."
"@neiltyson @Space_Station Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space."

"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it"
"@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
"@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."

"@hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
"@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."

"@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high.

@bitbased @Antsmash @joseph_preece @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates That’s actually kinda true
@SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
@lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
"@baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent."
"@Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000, as all seats would be “coach” &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands."
"@YusifzadaAgshin About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
"@ebelliveau @SciGuySpace Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible."

Falcon Heavy on LC-39A https://t.co/FsfFa7bRRK
"@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms 🤗"
@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
"@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
"@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.

"@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1."

"@HarryStoltz1 @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year."
"@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year."

"@BdgBill @teslaownersSV @Tesla Based on our data, Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles, and we expect this to improve further"
@AnthonyFinno @RobertOHaver @Tesla Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto &amp; oil companies aren’t known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors &amp; space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
"@13ericralph31 @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20."
"@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result."
@kimitalvitie @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Wings/flaps &amp; leg design changing again (sigh). Doesn’t affect schedule much though.
@kimitalvitie @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Not bad
@Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Exactly. We’re on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons.
"@Teslatunity @Everman @AndyKiersz Yeah, the fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights"

@SPEXcast @WentaiW @1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX Good idea
@WentaiW @1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX True. I’m a gamer &amp; my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
@cleantechnica Yup
@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Would love to do exactly that
"@Cosmic_Penguin Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun."
"@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science."
@John_Gardi @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
"@GoForStaging @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy."
"@1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers"
"@13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map. https://t.co/83MwIZAEP6 https://t.co/NllMXregRg"
"@varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible. https://t.co/OuWYfNmw0D"
"@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency."
@meme0boi Fair
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
@DJSnM Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
"@SPEXcast @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars."
"@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum."

Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
"@quayran Opposite is true: you can have 100’s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below"
"@flcnhvy @DMC_Ryan Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly &amp; directly that it doesn’t matter"

@kateconger Gary the 🐌 still crushes us! Wouldn’t be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.

"Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question."
"Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?"

@tsrandall Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.

@SpaceXFan97 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes
"@Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX This will sound implausible, but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9"
@13ericralph31 @John_Gardi @SpaceX Close
"@John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
@SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
"@_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
"@John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky."
@13ericralph31 @SpaceX I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
